## Global Lessons

- tool made no changes - trying different approach
- fixer made no changes
- Fix for src/resolver.ts rejected: The diff only adds an import for `rm` from 'fs/promises' but doesn't show any actual code changes that use it to replace the `execSync` calls. The security vulnerabilities around command execution, validation, timeout, and sandboxing remain unaddressed.
- Fix for README.md rejected: The diff does not contain the suggested platform-specific installation instructions. It only updates model names and rotation strategy, missing the curl command clarification for macOS ARM64 vs other platforms.
- Fix for README.md rejected: The diff updates model versions but doesn't update the actual model table entries from the outdated names (opus-4.5, sonnet-4.5, gpt-5.2-codex-xhigh, etc.) to the correct canonical Cursor CLI names.
- Fix for README.md rejected: The provided diff doesn't include the platform-specific installation instructions. It shows the same model table changes from other fixes but lacks the cursor-agent installation updates for Linux and Intel Mac users mentioned in the review.
- Fix for DEVELOPMENT.md rejected: The diff removes the language identifier from the code fence (changes `text` to nothing), which worsens the MD040 violation rather than fixing it as requested.
- Fix for DEVELOPMENT.md rejected: The fix removes the language identifier (`text`) instead of adding it, changing `` ```text `` to just `` ``` ``, which violates the MD040 requirement to specify a language.
- Fix for DEVELOPMENT.md rejected: The change removes the language identifier (`text`) from the code fence instead of adding one. The diff shows ```` ```text` ` changing to just `` ``` ``, which is the opposite of what the review requested. This will fail the markdownlint MD040 check.
- Fix for DEVELOPMENT.md rejected: The code change removes the language identifier (`text`) from the fence, changing ` ```text` to ` ``` `, which makes the problem worse and violates the MD040 rule rather than fixing it.
- Fix for src/resolver.ts - When using `execSync`, always include `shell: false` option and pass command/args as array to prevent shell injection, not just whitelist validation.
- Fix for DEVELOPMENT.md rejected: The diff shows an incomplete fix - it adds a line break between the backticks and "text" instead of properly formatting it as ` ```text `, which does not satisfy the MD040 requirement for language-tagged code blocks.
- Fix for src/resolver.ts - "Security fixes require implementation changes, not just imports. Address each vulnerability mentioned: add input validation, reduce timeout, replace execSync calls."
- Fix for README.md rejected: The diff only updates model version strings and rotation examples, not the platform-specific installation instructions for cursor-agent that were requested (macOS ARM64 vs Linux vs Intel Mac).
- Fix for src/resolver.ts rejected: The diff changes resolver.ts to handle wrong files, but the review comment is about fixing `fixedIssues` which is computed from `unresolvedIssues`. The diff doesn't change the `fixedIssues` pipeline to use the full `comments` list instead.
- Fix for src/git/commit.ts rejected: The diff modifies `commit.ts` lines related to `hasChanges` and `scanCommittedFixes`, but the review comment is about fixing a regex for emoji matching at line 267. The wrong file/section was changed.
- Fix for README.md rejected: The diff changes model version strings but doesn't standardize the model naming format across the README as requested (mixing date-stamped and dotted formats).
- Fix for src/runners/cursor.ts rejected: The diff shown only modifies the regex pattern but doesn't implement the stdin-based prompt passing approach required to address the E2BIG risk, missing the core fix of removing `args.push(prompt)` and writing to stdin.
- Fix for src/git/commit.ts rejected: The code change removes imports (`execSync`, `execFileSync`) and adds a `redactAuth()` function with multiple `redactAuth()` calls, but does not fix the regex issue with emoji combining characters at line 267 that was the focus of the review.
- Fix for src/runners/cursor.ts rejected: The code change shown is identical to the first fix and does not address the E2BIG issue. The prompt is still being passed as a positional argument rather than via stdin, and there is no modification to use `stdio: ['pipe', 'pipe', 'pipe']` or `child.stdin?.write()`.
- Fix for src/git/commit.ts rejected: The review comment requests updating the emoji regex at line 267 to use Unicode property escapes like `\p{Emoji}`, but the diff shows unrelated changes to imports and a new `redactAuth()` function with no regex changes to the emoji stripping pattern.
- Fix for src/runners/cursor.ts rejected: The review comment requests changes to handle E2BIG by passing prompt via stdin (lines 271-276), but the provided diff only shows the parseAndPrioritizeModels function being duplicated. The actual stdin implementation is missing.
- Fix for src/runners/cursor.ts rejected: Same issue as above - shellEscape() is defined twice but never applied to workdir or promptFile variables in the vulnerable shell command string
- Fix for README.md rejected: The diff shows model table changes and API endpoint additions, but does not address the core issue of standardizing model name formats (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 vs claude-sonnet-4.5 vs claude-sonnet-4.5) across the README as requested.
- Fix for README.md rejected: The diff shows unrelated table changes at lines 571-582 but does not modify lines 78-83 in the README where the PRR_LLM_MODEL example needs to be aligned with the canonical date-stamped format from config.ts.
- Fix for src/runners/cursor.ts rejected: The fix does not address the E2BIG risk—the diff shows only comments updated and temp file handling added, but the prompt is still passed as a positional argument via `args.push()` rather than being sent via stdin as required by the review.
- Fix for src/runners/cursor.ts rejected: Similar to the previous fix, this only adds the `shellEscape` function definition but doesn't demonstrate it being used to escape `workdir` and `promptFile` paths in the actual shell command on line 89. The function is dead code without application.
- Fix for src/runners/cursor.ts rejected: Identical issue to the previous fix - duplicate function definition and the `shellEscape` function is defined but not actually applied to escape `workdir` or `promptFile` in the shell command.
- Fix for src/runners/claude-code.ts rejected: The code change only updates an error message string and does not address either of the two main issues: (1) the fixed filename `.prr-prompt.txt` collision risk, or (2) the premature prompt write before model validation. The actual prompt file handling logic remains unchanged.
- Fix for src/cli.ts rejected: The diff shows a duplicate function definition of `parseIntOrExit` (appears twice in the same file) rather than replacing the raw `parseInt` calls throughout the code. The proposed fix was not properly applied - it only added the helper function but didn't update the call sites.
- Fix for src/resolver.ts rejected: Only adds `rm` import but doesn't show actual implementation changes to use it instead of `execSync`, nor reduces timeout or adds validation
- Fix for src/runners/cursor.ts rejected: Diff shows the duplicate model parsing code again instead of changes to pass prompt via stdin and remove positional argument approach
- Fix for src/cli.ts rejected: The diff only removes a nullish coalescing operator from `maxContextChars` but doesn't add the `parseIntOrDefault` validation helper function needed to prevent NaN propagation.
- Fix for README.md rejected: The fix only clarifies the heading and adds a generic link, but doesn't provide the platform-specific instructions (Linux, Intel Mac) that were requested in the review comment
- Fix for README.md rejected: The diff shows changes to line 576 about model listing commands, but the review requested verification and removal of unverified models like `gpt-5.2` and `Grok` from the table, which are not addressed
- Fix for src/logger.ts rejected: The change only reorders the type check condition but doesn't address the unused initial value of overallTotals mentioned in the review comment.
- Fix for src/resolver.ts rejected: The timeout reduction addresses one concern, but ignores the main security issues: no validation of working directory safety, no protection against shell injection, no use of Node.js APIs instead of execSync, and no process monitoring improvements.
- Fix for README.md rejected: The fix only adds a clarification comment and a generic link, but does not provide the platform-specific instructions (Linux, Intel Mac) that the review explicitly requested
- Fix for README.md rejected: The code change only reformats table formatting, but does not update the README example to match the canonical date-stamped model name from config.ts or add clarifying comments
- Fix for src/runners/llm-api.ts rejected: The diff does not match the review comment - it shows the same change as the first fix instead of implementing the ReDoS mitigation for the whitespace pattern on line 232. The suggested change to use `\s{1,1000}` is not present in the diff.
- Fix for .prr/lessons.md rejected: The fix removes malformed entries and deduplicated some lines, but the deduplication is incomplete. Many entries still contain
- Fix for CLAUDE.md rejected: The fix removes corrupted entries from CLAUDE.md, but does not address the root cause identified in the review comment—the lessons generation logic that produces these malformed entries. The CLAUDE.md file was manually cleaned, but the generator function that syncs from `.prr/lessons.md` and creates the malformed "Instructions" section was not identified or fixed, so the problem will recur.
- Fix for src/runners/llm-api.ts rejected: The diff shown modifies the wrong section (isPathSafe logic) instead of the regex pattern on line 232 mentioned in the review comment
- Fix for src/runners/llm-api.ts rejected: The diff shown modifies the isPathSafe logic instead of removing the unused `join` import from the import statement
- Fix for src/runners/llm-api.ts rejected: The diff shows the opposite change - it replaces the simplified logic with the more complex condition that the review criticized as problematic
- Fix for src/runners/llm-api.ts rejected: The diff does not match the file or line numbers - it appears to be the same unrelated change from the first fix, not addressing the ReDoS vulnerability in the regex pattern
- Fix for src/runners/llm-api.ts rejected: The diff does not show the import statement being modified - it shows the same unrelated logic change, failing to remove the unused `join` import
- Fix for src/runners/llm-api.ts rejected: The diff shows the same lines being changed (189-192) as the first fix, but the comment references line 232 and a regex pattern change. The actual change needed to address the ReDoS vulnerability is not present in this diff.
- Fix for src/runners/llm-api.ts rejected: The code change shown is identical to the first fix and does not implement the ReDoS mitigation suggestion. The whitespace pattern limiting is not applied.
- Fix for src/runners/llm-api.ts rejected: The diff provided does not contain any changes to line 232 or the regex pattern mentioned in the review comment. The diff only shows the same path safety logic changes as fix_PRRC_kwDOQ_Yy5c6kTeOq.
- Fix for src/runners/llm-api.ts rejected: The diff provided does not show the import statement change. The diff only shows the same path safety logic changes, and there is no modification to remove the unused `join` import from the path module imports.
- Fix for src/runners/llm-api.ts rejected: The code change reverses the simplification—it replaces the simplified logic with the more complex condition that the review criticized as problematic, making the condition less safe by reintroducing the flawed logic.
- Fix for .prr/lessons.md rejected: The diff only removes duplicate/malformed entries from the lessons file itself but does not fix the root cause—the lessons extraction/serialization logic that generates these code fragments. The corrupted entries will recur on next generation.
- Fix for .prr/lessons.md rejected: The diff removes duplicate and malformed entries from `.prr/lessons.md` but does not modify the underlying compaction/deduplication logic in the code. The malformed headers and duplicates will be regenerated until the source function (compactLessons, dedupeLessons, etc.) is fixed.
- Fix for CLAUDE.md rejected: The diff cleans up CLAUDE.md by removing duplicate entries and reorganizing sections, but does not implement sanitization logic to strip parsing artifacts like " - ts" from headers. The malformed headers will recur when lessons are regenerated.
- Fix for src/runners/llm-api.ts rejected: The diff shown does not actually remove the `join` import - it displays the same path safety logic change from the first fix, failing to address the unused import issue
- Fix for .prr/lessons.md rejected: The diff removes duplicate entries and consolidates the lessons file, but does not fix the root cause - the lessons generation/compaction logic that produces these malformed entries will continue to regenerate them
- Fix for CLAUDE.md rejected: The diff reorganizes and cleans up CLAUDE.md entries but does not implement sanitization logic to strip the parsing artifacts like " - ts" from section headers, so malformed headers will recur upon regeneration
- Fix for CLAUDE.md rejected: The diff shown is identical to fix_PRRC_kwDOQ_Yy5c6kUCxi and does not implement any sanitization logic in LessonsManager to strip the " - ts" suffixes from malformed headers
- Fix for src/resolver.ts:1035 - tool made no changes without explanation
- Fix for src/resolver.ts:2549 - tool made no changes without explanation - trying different approach
- Fix for src/runners/opencode.ts:93 - tool made no changes without explanation - trying different approach
- Fix for src/runners/opencode.ts:94 - When adding file creation, implement cleanup in all exit paths (resolve/reject/error) using try-finally or a cleanup callback to prevent leaks.
- Fix for src/state/manager.ts:117 - When a requirement specifies "call X after Y", the fix must include the actual call statement, not just documentation describing it.
- Fix for src/state/manager.ts:384 rejected: The change modifies `clearInterrupted()` to be async and add a save call, but completely ignores the actual bug in `compactLessons()` that was described in the review comment. The fix addresses a different issue entirely.
- Fix for src/state/manager.ts:117 - tool made no changes
- Fix for src/state/lessons.ts:613 rejected: The diff filters transient error patterns and marks repo lessons clean on success, but doesn't fix the Windows drive-letter path parsing issue in addLesson.
- Fix for src/state/lessons.ts:625 - Anchor the regex on message suffixes like " rejected:" or " - " to reliably separate filePath from line numbers, rather than relying solely on the last `:digits` pattern.
- Fix for src/state/lessons.ts:537 - Since the fix is already in place and the code matches the proposed solution, no changes are needed.
- Fix for src/state/lessons.ts:625 - Since the fix is already in place and the code matches the proposed solution, no changes are needed.
- Fix for src/runners/cursor.ts:31 rejected: The diff changes stdin handling but does not update the FALLBACK_MODELS array. The review comment specifically requested updating outdated model names in the fallback list at lines 24-31, which is not present in this diff.
- Fix for src/runners/cursor.ts:243 rejected: The diff changes stdin handling and prompt passing but does NOT move the prompt file from workdir to tmpdir as requested. The security issue about writing `.prr-prompt.txt` to the workspace and lacking cleanup is not addressed.
- Fix for src/runners/cursor.ts:256 rejected: The temp file is created but the isSafePath check is removed without replacement, and there is no cleanup logic (unlinkSync call) after the process completes.
- Fix for src/runners/cursor.ts:91 rejected: The fix duplicates the entire parsing loop instead of modifying the existing one, resulting in redundant code that processes lines twice.
- Fix for src/git/commit.ts:140 - tool modified wrong files (examples/feedback-loop-example.ts, src/resolver.ts, src/runners/cursor.ts), need to modify src/git/commit.ts
- Fix for src/git/commit.ts:389 - tool made no changes without explanation - trying different approach
- Fix for src/git/commit.ts:346 - tool made no changes without explanation - trying different approach
- Fix for src/llm/client.ts:115 rejected: The diff shows unrelated cleanup code instead of fixing the fixedIssues filter to use the full comments list rather than unresolvedIssues.
- Fix for src/llm/client.ts:319 - tool made no changes without explanation - trying different approach
- Fix for src/llm/client.ts:319 - The code after `Updated upstream` already has the fix with `allowedIds` validation, but the merge conflict needs to be cleaned up.
- Fix for README.md:573 rejected: The diff updates model versions but doesn't correct the CLI command (should be `agent models` or `cursor-agent - list-models`) or verify/update the gpt-5.2 and Grok model names.
- Fix for README.md:231 rejected: The diff updates model versions and rotation examples but doesn't fix the markdown indentation issues (MD005/MD007) in the nested list bullets under "Run Fixer".
- Fix for README.md:576 - tool modified wrong files (src/config.ts, src/git/clone.ts, src/git/commit.ts, src/resolver.ts, src/state/manager.ts), need to modify README.md
- Fix for README.md:1 - tool made no changes without explanation - trying different approach
- Fix for src/runners/claude-code.ts:156 rejected: The diff improves the permission error message but doesn't defer prompt file creation until after model validation or use a unique temporary filename to prevent collisions.
- Fix for src/runners/claude-code.ts:211 rejected: The diff is identical to the previous fixes and does not address the misleading error message. The error message should be updated to reflect whether skip-permissions is already enabled, but no such change is present.
- Fix for src/cli.ts:133 rejected: The diff only adds parseIntOrExit for numeric validation but doesn't update the FixerTool type to include new runners ('claude-code', 'aider', 'codex', 'llm-api') or update validateTool() and CLI help text.
- Fix for src/cli.ts:151 - tool modified wrong files (src/config.ts, src/git/clone.ts, src/git/commit.ts, src/resolver.ts, src/runners/cursor.ts, src/state/manager.ts), need to modify src/cli.ts
- Fix for src/cli.ts:170 rejected: The diff only removes the `?? 400_000` fallback from `maxContextChars` but the comment indicates `maxStaleCycles` should also be changed to use nullish coalescing instead of `||`, which is missing from the diff.
- Fix for src/git/clone.ts:452 rejected: The diff adds merge completion logic but the merge abort on error path is missing—the suggested fix shows aborting merge on both conflict and generic error returns.
- Fix for FIXER_EXPLANATION_REQUIREMENT.md:78 - md` file already have the correct template literal syntax with backticks.
- Fix for FIXER_EXPLANATION_REQUIREMENT.md:78 - tool made no changes
- Fix for src/config.ts:61 - tool made no changes without explanation - trying different approach
- Fix for src/config.ts:168 rejected: The change only removes the mention of 'auto' from the error message but does not separate 'auto' validation from actual tool validation or document that 'auto' should be resolved before storage. The underlying issue—that 'auto' is checked alongside real tools—remains unaddressed.
- Fix for CLAUDE.md:94 - When fixing corrupted generated content, sanitize the source before regenerating, not just the output structure—fix the generator logic, not the symptoms.
- Fix for .prr/lessons.md:172 - When a review requests fixing root-cause logic in code, don't fix symptoms in output files—locate and modify the actual function (compactLessons, dedupeLessons, etc.) that generates the output.

## File-Specific Lessons

### src/state/lessons.ts:305

- Fix for src/state/lessons.ts:305 rejected: The diff removes extractPrrSection but also adds unrelated code to normalizeLessonText (access modifier check and extra cleaning), which goes beyond the stated requirement to remove only the unused method

### src/state/lessons.ts:359

- Fix for src/state/lessons.ts:359 rejected: The diff removes extractPrrSection but adds unrelated normalization logic instead of adding direct unit tests for normalizeLessonText as requested in the review comment

### src/git/commit.ts:108

- Fix for src/git/commit.ts:108 - Implement the `restoreRemote()` helper function first, then call it in all four exit paths (timeout, SIGINT, close, error handlers).

### tests/normalizeLessonText.test.ts:88

- Fix for tests/normalizeLessonText.test.ts:88 - The fix must replace the actual test bodies with `it.todo(...)` or real assertions—removing imports alone doesn't address the no-op test cases.
