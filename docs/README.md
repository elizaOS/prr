# PRR Documentation Index

Welcome to the PRR documentation! This directory contains comprehensive guides and flowcharts explaining how the PR Resolver system works. We document **why** design choices were made (not just what) so you can revisit decisions and avoid regressions — see also the main [README](../README.md) philosophy.

### 📉 Audit Improvements
Token-saving, exit-logic, and fix-loop improvements are documented in the [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md) under "Audit improvements" and "Output.log audit" headings.

**Output.log audit follow-up (2026-02)** — rebase detection, push retry, non-interactive rebase:
- **Rebase detection**: `completeMerge` and the pull conflict loop use `--show-toplevel` to get the repo root so `.git/rebase-merge` is checked with an absolute path. **WHY**: Relative `.git` was resolved against process cwd, not the PRR workdir, so we often ran `commit` during a rebase and left `.git/rebase-merge` behind.
- **Push retry cleanup**: On failed fetch+rebase after push rejection, we try `rebase --abort` first, then `cleanupGitState` only if abort fails. **WHY**: Abort keeps commits; full cleanup is for stale state so the next run doesn’t hit "rebase-merge directory already exists".
- **Non-interactive rebase continue**: All `rebase --continue` calls go through `continueRebase(git)` in `git-merge.ts`, which sets `GIT_EDITOR=true` before running rebase. **WHY**: In headless/workdir there’s no TTY; the configured editor fails ("Standard input is not a terminal" / "problem with the editor 'editor'"). One helper keeps behavior consistent.
- **Dead code**: Removed unused `src/git/clone.ts`; clone/merge logic lives in `git-clone-core`, `git-merge`, and `git-lock-files` (see CHANGELOG "Fixed — Rebase detection, push retry cleanup").

**Output.log audit (2026-02)** — model and prompt behavior:
- **Model rotation & skip list**: Default llm-api/elizacloud lists ordered by fix success; models that 500/timeout or have 0% fix rate are in `ELIZACLOUD_SKIP_MODELS` and never selected. **WHY**: Reduces wasted rotation slots and improves throughput.
- **File injection**: Inject files by issue count (most first) and tie injection budget to model context cap. **WHY**: Better S/R success when cap is tight; avoids overshooting small-context or underusing large-context models.
- **Rewrite escalation**: Escalate to full-file rewrite for files not injected (LLM never saw content) or with repeated S/R failures. **WHY**: Avoids S/R matching failures when the model has no file content to copy from.
- **Duplicate prompt hash**: Use issue IDs + lesson count instead of full prompt so same-issues-same-context skips to rotation. **WHY**: Full-prompt hash rarely matched; avoids redundant LLM calls.
- **Proportional batch reduce**: Reduce batch by `cap/promptLength` instead of halving. **WHY**: Converges in 1–2 iterations instead of many.
- **504 retries**: Two retries with 10s/20s backoff. **WHY**: Transient gateways get a chance to recover.
- **AAR exhausted list**: List `path:line` for all exhausted issues in the After-Action Report. **WHY**: Makes human follow-up actionable.

**Prompts.log audit (2026-02)** — conflict prompt size and large-file embedding:
- **Skip file injection for conflict prompts**: In `injectFileContents` (llm-api), prompts starting with `MERGE CONFLICT RESOLUTION` are returned unchanged (no file injection). **WHY**: The conflict prompt builder already embeds each file; re-injecting would duplicate content (e.g. CHANGELOG twice), causing 140k+ char prompts and 504s.
- **Chunked embed for large conflicted files**: For files over 30k chars with conflict markers, only conflict sections (with 7 lines context) are embedded; section headers show the actual line range; instructions tell the LLM to use the plain file path in `<change path="...">`. **WHY**: Full-file embed doubled prompt size and caused 504s; sections are enough for correct search/replace blocks.
- **Conflict model fallback and context cap**: When `getCurrentModel()` is undefined (e.g. setup phase), Attempt 2 falls back to `DEFAULT_ELIZACLOUD_MODEL` for ElizaCloud; "file too large" uses the effective model’s context limit. **WHY**: Avoids weak default (qwen-3-14b) that may 504; correct limit prevents wrongly skipping files that fit the actual model’s window.

**Prompts.log audit follow-up (2026-02)** — relax file constraint, dismissal skip, judge rule, model recommendation:
- **Relax file constraint**: When the fixer returns CANNOT_FIX/WRONG_LOCATION and mentions another file, we persist that path in `wrongFileAllowedPathsByCommentId` and merge it into `allowedPaths` on the next attempt so the fixer can edit the correct file. **WHY**: Audit showed 7 identical 33k-char prompts for one cross-file issue; persisting the other file avoids burning all models and can resolve the issue on retry.
- **Skip dismissal LLM for already-fixed**: We no longer call the LLM to generate a Note for `already-fixed` issues; code/diff is self-documenting. **WHY**: 62% of dismissal LLM responses were EXISTING; skipping saves tokens.
- **Judge rule**: Verification prompt now says "If the Current Code already implements what the review asks for, respond NO and cite the specific code." **WHY**: Reduces unnecessary ALREADY_FIXED fix attempts when the judge would otherwise say YES.
- **Model recommendation wording**: Prompt asks "explain why these models in this order" instead of "brief reasoning". **WHY**: Models echoed "brief reasoning" literally; the new wording yields actionable explanation.

**Prompts.log audit (2026-02) — verifier before snippet, model rec skip, no-op skip verify, escalation delay, predict-bots skip:**
- **Verifier "Code before fix"**: Batch verification prompt now includes a "Code before fix" section (removed lines from the diff) alongside "Current Code (AFTER)" so the verifier can compare before vs after. **WHY**: Verifier was only seeing post-fix code; with before snippet it can determine whether the issue was actually fixed and reduce false rejections (audit: one correct fix took 17 iterations due to verifier rejections).
- **Skip model recommendation for fewer than 3 issues**: The separate model-recommendation LLM call runs only when there are 3+ unresolved issues; otherwise we use default rotation. **WHY**: Saves ~29s and tokens on simple runs.
- **All-no-op = no changes**: When every fixer change block was a no-op (search === replace), we treat the iteration as "no changes" and skip verification (runner returns `noMeaningfulChanges`; workflow skips `handleNoChangesWithVerification` and goes to rotation). **WHY**: Avoids running the verifier on unchanged code and keeps "file modified" accurate.
- **Delay full-file escalation for simple issues**: For files where all targeting issues have importance ≤ 3 and ease ≤ 2, we only escalate to full-file rewrite when the file was not injected (not when over S/R failure threshold). **WHY**: Full-file rewrites are expensive and time out more; for simple issues we rely on S/R first.
- **Skip predict-bots when --no-wait-bot**: The LLM "likely new bot feedback" prediction is skipped when `--no-wait-bot` is set. **WHY**: Prediction is display-only and runs after commit; skipping saves ~26s when the user isn't waiting for bot reviews.

**Fetch timeout and token auth (2026-03)** — conflict check and pull no longer hang:
- **Fetch via spawn with 60s timeout**: Conflict check and remote-ahead check run `git fetch` via spawn; on timeout the error includes git stdout/stderr (e.g. password prompt). **WHY**: simple-git fetch could hang indefinitely; timeout + output make credential/network issues obvious.
- **GitHub token for fetch/pull**: When `origin` is HTTPS with no credentials, we use a one-shot auth URL (same as push) so fetch and pull never prompt for password. **WHY**: Headless runs have no TTY; token from config unblocks setup and fix-loop sync. See [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md) "Added (2026-03) — Git fetch: timeout, stdout on timeout, GitHub token auth".

**CLAUDE.md / sync target fix (2026-03)** — do not delete repo-owned files:
- **Sync target state in setWorkdir**: `setWorkdir` in `tools/prr/state/lessons-context.ts` now uses `Detect.autoDetectSyncTargets(ctx)` so both `syncTargets` and `originalSyncTargetState` are set. **WHY**: A local helper previously only set `syncTargets`; cleanup uses `didSyncTargetExist(ctx, 'claude-md')` to decide whether to remove CLAUDE.md — with an empty `originalSyncTargetState` we always assumed we had created it and deleted it at end of run, nuking the repo's CLAUDE.md when the user never ran `--clean-claude-md`.
- **Re-detect after clone**: In `tools/prr/workflow/run-setup-phase.ts`, after `cloneOrUpdateRepository()` we call `LessonsAPI.Detect.autoDetectSyncTargets(lessonsContext)` again. **WHY**: On first run the workdir is empty when we set workdir and detect; clone runs later and may check out CLAUDE.md. Without re-detection we would still record "didn't exist" and delete it at final cleanup. Re-running after clone ensures we only remove sync targets we actually created this run.

**Output.log audit follow-up (2026-03)** — allowed paths, CodeRabbit meta, (PR comment):
- **Runner allowed paths**: In `tools/prr/workflow/execute-fix-iteration.ts`, `allowedPathsForBatch` is built by expanding each issue with `getMigrationJournalPath`, `getConsolidateDuplicateTargetPath`, and `getImplPathForTestFileIssue` (same as prompt-builder). **WHY**: The prompt asked the fixer to edit e.g. `db/migrations/meta/_journal.json` for Drizzle migration issues, but the runner's allow-list used only `issue.allowedPaths`/`comment.path`, so journal edits were rejected as "disallowed file" and fixes never applied.
- **CodeRabbit meta comments**: `isCodeRabbitMetaComment` in `tools/prr/github/api.ts` now matches `<!-- This is an auto-generated reply` and `✅ Actions performed`; the same filter is applied to issue comments so those blurbs are not treated as fixable. **WHY**: CodeRabbit's confirmation blurb is not a code review; sending it to the fix loop wasted iterations and produced only UNCLEAR/WRONG_LOCATION.
- **(PR comment) dismissal**: In `tools/prr/workflow/helpers/solvability.ts`, issues whose path is the synthetic `(PR comment)` are dismissed as `not-an-issue` before any LLM call. **WHY**: The fixer cannot edit a non-file; every attempt fails and burns iterations.

**Prompts.log audit: dedup, verifier strength, dismissal comments, multi-file (2026-03)** — Cycle 10:
- **Dismissal skip when file no longer exists**: In `tools/prr/workflow/dismissal-comments.ts`, we filter out issues whose dismissal reason matches "file no longer exists" / "file not found" before building the commentable list. **WHY**: Audit showed a dismissal-comment prompt sent for a file with reason "File no longer exists: stores/task.store.ts"; the LLM was asked to write a comment in a missing file, wasting tokens and producing a comment that would never be inserted.
- **Post-filter generic dismissal comments**: In `tools/prr/llm/client.ts` (`generateDismissalComment`), after parsing `COMMENT: Note: ...` we check if the comment mostly restates the surrounding code (2–8 words, ≥2 words appear in code); if so we return `needed: false`. **WHY**: gpt-4o-mini often produced comments like "extracts relevant metrics" that only narrate the code; they add no value and we skip inserting them.
- **Heuristic dedup same-caller**: In `tools/prr/workflow/issue-analysis.ts`, `callerFileFromBody(body)` extracts a caller file (e.g. "runner.py:146", "in runner.py"); heuristic dedup now merges two comments on the same file when they share the same primary symbol and the same caller file, even when authors differ. **WHY**: Audit showed dedup returning NONE for four comments; cursor and claude both described the same async/caller mismatch but weren't grouped, so duplicate issues reached the fix prompt.
- **Multi-file nudge**: In `tools/prr/analyzer/prompt-builder.ts`, when TARGET FILE(S) has multiple files and the review body mentions callers (calls, caller, await, file:line), we add: "This issue requires changes in **all** listed files — update the implementation and every call site so signatures match." **WHY**: The fixer had updated only reporting.py while runner.py was in TARGET FILE(S); the verifier correctly rejected because the call site wasn't updated; the nudge reduces incomplete multi-file fixes.
- **Verifier model floor for API/signature fixes**: In `tools/prr/workflow/fix-verification.ts`, `commentMentionsApiOrSignature(fix)` detects async/await, signature/caller/TypeError, method accepts/takes; such fixes are verified with a stronger model when available. **WHY**: The default verifier (e.g. qwen-3-14b) approved a fix that missed the call-site update (print_results still calling generate_report() without await/args); stronger verifier for API-related fixes reduces "fixed then broken at call site".

**Security & cleanup (2026-02)** — credential redaction, worktree, conflict-resolve, commit:
- **Credential redaction**: All push and rebase error/debug logs in `git-push.ts` use `redactUrlCredentials()` so `https://token@...` is never logged; same redaction is used for fetch timeout/error output in `git-conflicts.ts`. **WHY**: Git stderr and error messages can contain remote URLs with tokens; redacting prevents credential leakage.
- **Worktree rebase detection**: `getResolvedGitDir(git)` in git-merge.ts resolves the real git dir when `.git` is a file (worktree); used by `completeMerge` and the pull conflict loop in repository.ts. **WHY**: In worktrees the rebase-merge check would otherwise fail; one shared helper keeps behavior correct and consistent.
- **Sync target log**: "Removed sync target created by prr" is logged only when `git.rm` or fallback `git.add` succeeds. **WHY**: Avoids reporting success when both failed.
- **commit.ts**: Duplicate broken push/pushWithRetry code removed; file re-exports from git-push.ts. **WHY**: Single source of truth; fixes parse errors from mangled duplicate.

**Earlier audit items**: Dismissal-comment pre-check radius, no-op search/replace skip, lesson caps, dedup threshold, commit wording, think-tag stripping, verifier rejection cap, no-verified-progress exit — see CHANGELOG for full list and WHYs.

**Read this if**: You want to know why we reorder models, skip certain models, inject files by issue count, escalate to full-file rewrite, skip injection for conflict prompts, or embed only conflict sections for large files.

## 📖 Key Concepts Explained

### Recent improvements (rotation, batch reduce, injection, no-changes)

- **Rotation reset**: At the start of each push iteration (after the first), the model index resets to the first in rotation. *Why*: The previous cycle often ended on a model that had just 500'd or timed out; retrying it first wastes time.
- **Large-prompt batch reduce**: When a fix prompt exceeds ~200k chars and fails (error or no-changes), the next fix iteration uses a smaller batch immediately. *Why*: Oversized prompts cause gateway 500s/timeouts; reducing batch size keeps prompts within limits.
- **Injection cap with floor**: Base + injected file content is capped (e.g. 200k total) with a minimum injection allowance so key files are still injected when the base is large. *Why*: Prevents 500s from oversized requests and avoids zero injection when base is already big.
- **No-changes parsing**: The NO_CHANGES explanation is parsed from prose only; content inside `<change>`, `<newfile>`, and `<file>` blocks is stripped first. *Why*: Code or fixtures inside those blocks can contain phrases like "already fixed", causing false positives.
- **Line-number stripping**: When matching search/replace from LLM output, only the injected line format `N | ` is stripped from each line, not arbitrary leading digits. *Why*: Injected file content is numbered; some LLMs echo that in `<search>`/`<replace>`. Stripping only `N | ` allows matches without corrupting real code.

See [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md) (Unreleased → Added 2026-02) for full WHYs and file references.

### The Three Loops

### The Escalation Strategy

When fixes fail, PRR doesn't give up—it escalates:

```text
1. Batch Mode (optimistic)
   └─ Try fixing 50 issues at once

2. Adaptive Batching (progressive)
   └─ Halve batch size: 50 → 25 → 12 → 6 → 5

3. Single-Issue Mode (focused)
   └─ Pick 1-3 random issues for narrow context

4. Model Rotation (diversity)
   └─ Claude → GPT → Gemini (different families)

5. Tool Rotation (alternative)
   └─ cursor → claude-code → aider → gemini → ...

6. Direct LLM API (last resort)
   └─ Bypass tool wrappers, use API directly

7. Bail Out (graceful)
   └─ Commit partial progress, request human help
```

### State Management

PRR maintains state across interruptions:

```json
{
  "pr": "owner/repo#123",
  "iterations": [...],
  "commentStatuses": {
    "comment_123": {
      "status": "open",
      "classification": "exists",
      "fileContentHash": "abc123",
      "importance": 4,
      "ease": 3
    }
  },
  "verifiedFixed": ["comment_456"],
  "dismissedIssues": [
    {
      "commentId": "comment_789",
      "reason": "Already implemented via guard clause",
      "dismissedAt": "2026-02-25T00:00:00Z",
      "dismissedAtIteration": 3,
      "category": "already-fixed",
      "filePath": "src/example.ts",
      "line": 42,
      "commentBody": "Add null check"
    }
  ],
  "lessonsLearned": [...],
  "currentRunnerIndex": 2,
  "modelIndices": { "cursor": 3, "aider": 1 },
  "noProgressCycles": 0
}
```

**Why this matters**:
- Resume after Ctrl+C
- Skip redundant LLM analysis (caching)
- Track what was tried (lessons)
- Continue rotation from where it stopped
